To create a system where users can create teams, send requests to add members, and join existing teams, here's a possible approach to implement it in your application. This would involve setting up endpoints and logic for both "Create Teams" and "Join Teams" pages, as well as ensuring that the team schema is managed properly.

Below are the necessary steps and code to get you started:

### Step 1: Define Routes for Create Team and Join Team

Create two routes in your Express application, one for creating a team and one for joining an existing team. You'll also need to fetch the `eventId` from the URL and handle the logic based on the conditions you've provided.

#### 1.1 Create Team Route

```js
// teamRoutes.js

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Team = require('../models/team');
const Signup = require('../models/signup');
const { isLoggedIn } = require('../middleware/auth'); // Middleware to check if user is logged in

// Route to create a team
```

#### 1.2 Join Team Route

```js
// teamRoutes.js

// Route to join a team

```

#### 1.3 Accept/Reject Request by Team Leader

```js
// teamRoutes.js

// Route for team leader to accept/reject request

```

### Step 2: Frontend (Example)

Here's a simple front-end form to handle creating and joining teams. You can use React for the UI.

```jsx
// CreateTeam.js

```

### Step 3: Additional Considerations

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Use middleware to ensure that users are logged in before accessing routes.
2. **Team Full Status**: When a team reaches 4 members, set `isFull: true` and prevent further requests.
3. **UI for Requests**: Create a page where users can see pending requests and send them for team leaders to approve.
4. **Notifications/Emails**: Consider adding notifications to inform users when they are added to a team or when their request is approved/rejected.

This should help you build the functionality for creating and joining teams while handling member requests and updates to the `team` and `signup` documents.
